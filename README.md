# ofxBRTLibrary  
*Addon for OpenFrameworks to integrate the Binaural Rendering Toolbox (BRT)*

## Introduction  
**ofxBRTLibrary** is an OpenFrameworks addon that provides a simple interface to the [Binaural Rendering Toolbox (BRT)](https://github.com/GrupoDiana/BRTLibrary), a powerful set of libraries and tools for binaural spatialisation and psychoacoustic experimentation. This addon allows OpenFrameworks users to integrate real-time spatial audio rendering into their interactive applications, installations, or VR/AR projects.

This addon is developed in the context of the [SONICOM project](https://www.sonicom.eu/), and builds on the technology of the [3D Tune-In Toolkit](https://github.com/3DTune-In/3dti_AudioToolkit).

The included example demonstrates real-time spatialisation of a white noise source located at 45 degrees azimuth with respect to the listener.

For more complex use cases and experiments, refer to our extended example repository: [BRTLibrary_Examples](https://github.com/GrupoDiana/BRTLibrary_Examples).
